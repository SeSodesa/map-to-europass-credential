/*!
This Rust library defines a mapping between SISU attainments and Europass credentials.
SISU attainments retrievable via GET requests are described in
the [SISU Swagger UI](https://sis-tuni.funidata.fi/ori/swagger-ui.html#/attainment-controller/getAttainmentsUsingGET),
whereas information concerning the Europass credentials can be found on Github,
under the [Europass Learning Model documentation](https://github.com/european-commission-europass/Europass-Learning-Model/tree/master/Credentials).

SISU provides the attainments in JSON format,
whereas the Europass API accepts XML documents as input.
The mapping therefore needs to perform this JSON â†’ XML transformation.
The fields in the JSON provided by SISU also do not match the ones in Europass XML documents,
so in addition to a format transformation, a field transformation is performed as well.
